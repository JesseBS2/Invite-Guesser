# Invite-Guesser

When creating Discord servers, you obiously need to invite people; And that is done by making a link, generated by Discord, That link consists of 7 characters which can be any letter from the alphabet(lowercase and uppercase) or any number 0-9.
If we do the math then we'll know there are over 645 Septillion(short scale) different invite links.
Sending invites into servers can be done by typing "discord.gg/7RXnY6b" into a text channel. Some servers have custom links such as "discord.gg/minecraft" or "discord.gg/discord-api" but those must be verified by Discord.
Also a user doesn't need to be in a server to send a link to it.

Now, with all this in mind, we can create a bot that generates random characters and sends them into a channel; Discord will automatically turn it into an invite, chances are that the invite won't work becuase as I said before there are a lot of possible invites.
However, in the very *very* small odds that some server has came across those same characters, then when Discord turns it into a link, it will be working.
